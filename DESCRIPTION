Title: Permutation-Based Analysis associating Conserved Differentially
    Methylated Elements from One Generation to the Next to a Treatment Effect
Description: Permutation analysis, based on Monte Carlo sampling, for testing
    the hypothesis that the number of conserved differentially methylated
    elements, between several generations, is associated to an effect
    inherited from a treatment and that stochastic effect can be dismissed.
